	<h3>About this Proposal</h3>
	<p>When my editor encouraged me to submit an OSCON proposal, my problem was not having an idea: my problem was picking only one.  So I decided to pitch them all.  The "<a href="/page99">Choose Your Own Adventure</a>" books were favorites of mine when I was young, and I thought it would be a fun way to present my ideas.</p>
	<p>All of these proposals represent talks that I have the knowledge and resources to execute on.  Some of them will require more work to prepare for than others, but even the most ambitious of these proposals could be readied within two months with dedicated effort.</p>
	<p>Like O'Reilly, I would like to see more diversity in my field.  There's nothing I can do about my gender or skin color; however, some of my proposals are collaborative, and I would be bringing a little diversity to the stage that way.  In particular, the dancers I know that have expressed interest in <cite class="proposal">Digital Dancing</cite> (<a href="/page29">page 29</a>) are all women or minorities.</p>

	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p>I was practically born a technologist.  I followed in the footsteps of my father, an electrical engineer, earning undergraduate degrees in theoretical mathematics and computer science before embarking on a career as a software engineer.  I'm now a senior software engineer at <a href="http://popart.com">Pop Art</a>, a Portland-based interactive marketing agency, and I'm working on my first O'Reilly title, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032977.do"><cite>Web Development With Node and Express</cite></a>, due for publication in June.</p>
